Quibbler
========

Quibbler is an experimental Node.js web app powered by Socket.IO where people can type messages anonymously and see them flash on the screen for a moment, only to permanently disappear after a few seconds. All messages are randomly inserted into a cloud of messages, in real-time sync between all users. Messages are never saved anywhere.

It's pretty cool.
